**Tropical Automobile Sales Forecast Project**


**Overview**

This project develops effective revenue forecasting models using time-series methods applied to historical data on sales. It demonstrates mastery of time-series forecasting techniques while effectively communicating the analysis to a hypothetical hiring manager in the forecasting and data strategies team of a company. The data comprises two variables: 'logsales' representing the logarithm of sales revenue and 'date' indicating the timestamp of each observation. The methodology involves a comprehensive approach starting with exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns in sales data. Various time-series models such as ARIMA and SARIMA are implemented and evaluated based on their performance metrics. Model diagnostics and validation techniques are employed to ensure the reliability of the selected models. Key findings include the identification of trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the sales data. The developed forecasting models demonstrate the ability to generate accurate predictions of future sales revenue.


**Dataset**

The dataset consists of quarterly sales data for Tropical Automobile. Each observation includes the quarter and the corresponding sales figure.


**Methodology**

The forecasting model is developed using time series analysis techniques in R. The following steps are involved:

**Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded into R, and any necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or outliers, are performed.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the sales data.

**Modeling:** Several models are considered for forecasting, including ARIMA models. Model parameters are estimated using the provided data.

**Model Evaluation:** The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy metrics and visual inspection of forecasts.

**Forecasting:** Finally, the trained models are used to generate forecasts for future sales.


**Files**

**sales_data.csv:** The dataset containing quarterly sales data for Tropical Automobile.

**sales_forecast_script.R:** The R script containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model estimation, evaluation, and forecasting.


**Usage**

To run the project:

Ensure that R is installed on your system.

Download the provided dataset (sales_data.csv) and the R script (sales_forecast_script.R).

Open the R script in RStudio or any other R-compatible IDE.

Run the script. This will execute all the steps outlined in the methodology section and generate forecasts for Tropical Automobile sales.


**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis techniques in forecasting sales for Tropical Automobile. By accurately predicting future sales, the company can make informed decisions regarding production, inventory management, and resource allocation.
